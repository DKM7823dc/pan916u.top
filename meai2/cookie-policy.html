        <h1>COOKIE POLICY</h1>
        
        <p>Last Updated: June 15, 2025</p>
        
        <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Quantum Pulse ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
        
        <h2>1. WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h2>
        
        <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
        
        <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Quantum Pulse) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics).</p>
        
        <h2>2. WHY DO WE USE COOKIES?</h2>
        
        <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.</p>
        
        <h2>3. TYPES OF COOKIES WE USE</h2>

                <th>Type of Cookie</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Essential Cookies</td>
                <td>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Performance Cookies</td>
                <td>These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Analytics Cookies</td>
                <td>These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our website for you.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Marketing Cookies</td>
                <td>These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h2>4. HOW CAN YOU CONTROL COOKIES?</h2>
        
        <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager that we make available on our website.</p>
        
        <p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our website.</p>
        
        <h2>5. UPDATES TO THIS COOKIE POLICY</h2>
        
        <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
